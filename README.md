# octrees-benchmark

## Background

LiDAR (Light and Ranging Detection) technology has now become the quintessential technique for collecting geospatial data from the earth's surface. This code implements a linearized octree based on ideas from Keller et al. and Behley et al. for fast fixed-radius neighbourhood searches, achieving better performance than other Octrees and KD-trees tested, such as nanoflann KD-tree, picoTree, PCL Octree and KD-Tree, and unibnOctree. We also analyze the performance of Morton and Hilbert Space Filling Curves (SFCs). SFC Reordering allows for faster searches and is essential for the construction of the linear Octree. Extensive benchmarking and result plotting code and scripts are also provided.

## Installation

### Dependencies

Install system-level dependencies and build required libraries using the provided installation scripts:

**Build and install libraries:**
The project includes installation scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

- **LASlib** (required):
  ```bash
  bash scripts/install_laslib.sh
  ```

- **PAPI** (required for cache profiling):
  ```bash
  bash scripts/install_papi.sh
  ```

- **PCL** (optional, for PCL benchmark comparisons):
  ```bash
  bash scripts/install_pcl.sh
  ```
  If PCL is not found during compilation, the code will compile successfully but without PCL Octree and KD-Tree benchmark support.

- **Picotree** (optional, for Picotree benchmark comparisons):
  ```bash
  bash scripts/install_picotree.sh
  ```

### Compilation

#### Standard CPU Build (without CUDA)

In the project directory, just execute:
```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
cmake --build build
```

This creates the executable at `build/octrees-benchmark`.

#### CUDA GPU Acceleration Build

##### Prerequisites

This project requires CUDA 12.5+ and a compatible C++ compiler. The recommended approach is using **conda/micromamba** to manage the build environment.

**Step 1:** Create a conda environment with CUDA and dependencies
```bash
# Using conda
conda create -n cuda-build -c conda-forge gcc=12 gxx=12 cmake ninja cuda-toolkit=12.5 -y
conda activate cuda-build
```

**Step 2:** Build with CUDA support
```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_CUDA=ON .
cmake --build build
```

This creates the executable at `build/octrees-benchmark`.

### Execution
We provide scripts for replicating our results, check `bench_neighbors.bash` for kNN and fixed-radius neighbor searches, `bench_memory.bash` for the measurements of Octree and KD-tree sizes, and `bench_locality.bash` for benchmarks analyzing how SFCs improve locality.

Under the folder `plots` we include all the python scripts for generating the figures seen in the publication.

### Tests / Examples

A small usage example of the library features is provided under `examples/example.cpp`. It is automatically built alongside the main project.

```bash
make test_library
./tests/test_library
```

#### Running the full test suite

The project includes a comprehensive unit testing suite using GoogleTest. Build the project with option -DBUILD_TESTS=ON to enable it. After building the project, you can run all tests with:

```bash
make                # builds the library and all test executables
ctest --output-on-failure
```

You can also run individual test executables directly, e.g.:

```bash
./tests/test_points
./tests/test_encoders
./tests/test_octree
./tests/test_octree_advanced
```

To run a specific test case with CTest, use the `-R` option with the test name, for example:

```bash
ctest -R LinearOctreeTest.RadiusSearch
```
